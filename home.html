          <p>Our current ongoing project is the construction of six apartment blocks on the outskirts of Dublin City. 
             Each of these buildings will have six floors and will provide homes for over a thousand people.
             This is one of the largest projects we have taken on to date. 
             These buildings will also be fitted with solar panels so that they will be more environmentally friendly
             as the city looks to take steps in that direction and as we look to take steps in that direction as a 
             company. </p>
