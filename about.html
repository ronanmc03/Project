          <p>Our current project is certainly not the first one that our team has been involved in. We have plenty of work 
             behind us that we are very proud of. An example is the new environmentally friendly housing estate in South Dublin. 
             This estate inludes four hundred houses, each of which are fitted with solar panels. Another project we took
             on is the Lucan Hospital. This hospital is situated in Dublin West, just off the M4 motorway, very near the 
             interchange with the M50, meaning this hospital is quickly accessible from either side of the city, making 
             it convenient in the case of an emergency. We were also involved in the construction of the Leeside apartment blocks 
             in Cork. This project has the potential to provide up to five hundred people with affordable housing. </p>
