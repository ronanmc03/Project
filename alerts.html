    <h2>Safety Alerts</h2>
        
          <p>The safety and well-being of our workers is always our number one priority during the construction of our projects.
             We believe that all of our workers deserve a safe workplace.
             No one should go to work and not return home that evening and that is something that we are passionate about.
             We also take immense pride in our projects being successful and at the same time being built by completely safe workers.
             Positivity at the workplace is important to us as well and once everyone is assured of their safety at work it is far 
             more likely to be positive.</p>
